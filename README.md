# house-hunters-international

### Description

The purpose of this project is to:
- see which cities/countries people are moving to
- see which cities/countries people are moving from
- calculate the average distance traveled from origin to destination
- practice Name Entity Recognition to pull out geographies in episode descriptions


### Data

The data used for this analysis was scraped from the following website: [thetvdb.com](https://thetvdb.com/series/house-hunters-international/allseasons/official)

### App

### Challenges
- Not all cities and countries were available.  As much as I would love to sit down and watch every episode of House Hunters International to fill in the gaps where the episode descriptions or episode titles were insufficient, I don't have that kind of time.  The episodes with missing information were left out of the distance analyses.

### Things I Learned
- Of the episodes in my dataset, the origin country with the highest number of episodes was the United States (1032).  The top five destination countries were Australia (152), Mexico (137), France (88), Spain (87), and Netherland & Italy (84 each).
- Of the episodes in my dataset, the top 5 origin cities with the highest number of episodes were New York, New York (79), Los Angeles, California (54), Chicago, Illinois (44), London, England (41), and Washington, DC (38).  The top 5 destination cities were London, England (48), Amsterdam, Netherlands (41), Paris, France (31), Brisbane, Australia (26), and Melbourne, Australia (19).
