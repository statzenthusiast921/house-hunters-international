# house-hunters-international

### Description

The purpose of this project is to:
- see which cities/countries people are moving to
- see which cities/countries people are moving from
- calculate the average distance traveled from origin to destination
- practice Name Entity Recognition to pull out geographies in episode descriptions


### Data

The data used for this analysis was scraped from the following website: [thetvdb.com](https://thetvdb.com/series/house-hunters-international/allseasons/official)



### Challenges
- Not all cities and countries were available.  As much as I would love to sit down and watch every episode of House Hunters International to fill in the gaps where the episode descriptions or episode titles were insufficient, I don't have that kind of time.  The episodes with missing information were left out of the distance analyses.

### Things I Learned
- TBD
