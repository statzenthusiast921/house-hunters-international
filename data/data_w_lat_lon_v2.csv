1,"After attending college in the United States, 27-year-old Tyson Ennis returned home to Costa Rica and moved back in with his parents, who own a place in the city of Escazu (southwest of Costa Rica's capital, San Jose). Tyson is close to his family, but after living on his own, he now feels a little closed in. So, although it's customary for children in Costa Rica to live with their families until they marry, he is breaking tradition and searching for a space to call his own. He's hoping to find a place with two bedrooms and a view that is close to his parents' home, but he knows that with a budget equivalent to $150,000, he'll probably be limited to buying a condominium. With his family's blessing--and their input--the search is on.

He's looking to set up shop and find a condo in the high-end beach district of Punta Cana, known for its white sand beaches and luxury hotels. Scott's main priority is location- he'd love to be able to walk to the beach. He's also looking for a two-bedroom place so he can have a separate office and more storage, and he'd like a pool on the premises. He's hoping his real estate expertise will help him find all of these amenities in a 200 thousand dollar budget. Real estate agent and friend Frances Pimentel is going to help Scott on his search for the right place. The first condo that Frances shows Scott is a one-bedroom, one and a half bath condo right on a golf course. It's listed for 195 thousand dollars and is 1100 square feet.

Evan wants to be as close to their restaurant in the city center as he can get, while Maria-Isabel is seeking a quieter, possibly more distant refuge. They both agree on size: 2 bedrooms plus an office, and on style: they like historic homes, and appreciate architectural authenticity. They also like to entertain and would like a hip space to do so. Real Estate Agent Sean Dennis shows them an historic home in the heart of town. Evan and Maria-Isabel love the home's authentic details and view of the cathedral, but Maria-Isabel is concerned about noise. Next Sean shows them a Colonial Reproduction a few minutes outside the center of town.

Also, Maria-Isabel is still hoping for something more tranquil. Finally, Sean shows them a private island home on the lake.

Their daughter Kelsey and her fiance Dan are avid divers, so they're thrilled about the decision. Les and Anita are looking for a move-in ready 3 bedroom home that's large enough for the entire family and they really want a place that's close to the beach, has an ocean view and has room for a garden. Their budget is 300 thousand US dollars and they've enlisted Robert Sirois, a local realtor to assist them in their search. They've also created their own checklist to help rate each property and help them with their decision. The first place they see is a two bedroom, two bathroom 1800 square foot house in the Sunset Villa development listed for 289 thousand dollars. They really like the updated furnishings and the fact that it's only five minutes from the beach, but there is no ocean view. The next day Robert takes them to see a three bedroom, three bath 2100 square foot tri-level house in West End selling for 299 thousand dollars. They like the space and the nice views from each balcony, but the area in front of the house is being developed so there is no guarantee that they will keep their sea views. It also doesn't have a pool. The last place they see is an 1100 square foot 3 bedroom home in Turtle Crossing listed for 295 thousand dollars. It's close to the water, and has great views, but it's a bit small compared to the other properties and it needs some updating.

137,"Athos and Mary raised four children in the suburbs of Washington, DC. Now there are five grandchildren in the mix, and beach vacations are what they all enjoy most. Now that Athos and Mary have retired from the restaurant business they're ready to buy a vacation condo so the family can hit the beach together whenever they want. They're focusing their search on the Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic because they love the beautiful blue waters, crystal clear skies, and affordable prices. The first condo that real estate agent Rico Pester takes them to has 2 bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths in 1720 square feet. It is in a development that is still under construction. Athos loves the breathtaking beachfront views, and Mary loves the in-unit laundry hook-ups. But the condo is priced at $417,000, which is $17,000 over their budget. The other disadvantage is that the development is a significant drive to town. The next place they see is a little closer in. It's a semi-attached villa that is reminiscent of the Greek architecture of Athos's youth. It has a private courtyard with pool and a spectacular rooftop deck. There are 3 bedrooms and 3 baths. Mary loves the extra space, but is disappointed to hear there is no in-unit laundry hook-up. She also finds the kitchen a bit small, but Athos likes the price: $314,000. The third place Rico takes them to is listed for the even more affordable price of $277,000. It has 2 bedrooms and 2 baths in 1500 square feet. It does not have water views, but it is on a golf course, and is just a short ride to the beach by golf cart.

Now she and Dan want to introduce their children to her old world roots by buying a vacation home in the Abruzzo region of Italy where both Andrea's mother and grandmother are from. They have a budget of 100,000 Euro (equal to $140,000). They want a charming Italian cottage that has 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, some outdoor space, and a working kitchen. The first place Dan and Andrea and their kids go to see with their agent, Nicola Di Girolamo, is at the top of a very windy road in the Abruzzo region. The home has 2 beds and 1 bath in 1300 sq. ft., and it's listed for the equivalent of $116,000. The exterior of the home is built with stone from the region, but the owners have drilled parts of the wall which has created huge cracks inside the living room. The kitchen is outdated and has very old appliances but at least the bedrooms are a good size and have a nice view. They like that it comes with 1.24 acres of land, but they aren't crazy about the windy road and how much work the home needs. The second place Nikki takes them all to see is in a more accessible area, close to the lake in the town of Penne. It's a 2 bed, 1 bath, 860 square foot cottage listed for the equivalent of $163,000. They like the charming rounded windows and original fireplace, but the kitchen and bathroom are very outdated. They don't mind the small bedrooms that much, but they would like a better view of the half acre of land the house sits on. The third place Nikki takes them to see is near the town of Citta S'Angelo.

They're currently teaching Moroccan women how to make a living by using scraps of fabric to make purses. Since the family is visiting Morocco more and more frequently, Kevin and Kim want to buy a 2nd home there. They want a place with a rooftop terrace, a decent kitchen, 3 or 4 bedrooms and western style bathrooms. They have a budget of $250,000, and Kim is hoping to find something move-in ready while Kevin thinks it would be fun to buy a rundown place he can fix-up himself. Kevin is going alone to search for a home, so Kim can stay behind with the kids who are in the middle of the school year. The first place David Kellar, the Dooley's real estate agent, takes Kevin to see is a 2400 sqaure foot, 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom Dar (house or palace) listed for $210,000. This restored traditonal-style home is covered in Zellige tile and intricate plaster work. Kevin likes the size and layout of the rooms, but there is no working kitchen or bathrooms and the rooftop deck doesn't have the best views. The second place David takes Kevin to see is a complete fixer listed for $40,000. It has room for 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in about 1700 square feet. Kevin loves the low price and the idea of restoring the entire home and customising it to his family's needs. At the same time, he's worried that it might be too big of a project and it might take too long to complete. David can't make it for the 3rd house tour so he sends along his cultural liasion, Abdullah, instead. Abdullah takes Kevin to see a completely restored, 1800 square foot, 4 bedroom, 2.5 bath house that's priced at $210,000.

But despite their differences in personality, they agree that the family deserves the vacation home they've been saving ten years to afford. They'd like to buy a place now for vacations, and ultimately retire there. Their house in the planned community of Columbia, Maryland is large and comfortable, but it's far from the soothing sounds of the ocean that Loretta loves so much. They're focusing their search on the small island of Roatan, off the coast of Honduras, because of its peaceful beaches, and unspoiled feel. They'd like three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and while Loretta would like to wake up to the surf in her back yard and sand in her toes, Jim thinks an ocean view property would be a better investment. Their budget is $800,000. The first place Realtor Mike Carter shows them has three bedrooms and two baths in 2,000 square feet. It's a new, oceanfront development with luxury finishes, and the condo is listed at $699,000. They love the oceanfront location, but feel like the condo lacks privacy from the neighbors. The second place they see is a single family home. It has ocean views, luxury finishes, and is listed for $775,000. It is much larger than the first, with four bedrooms, fouir baths, and 3,000 square feet.

Perry's job as an Airline baggage handler means he works outside during even the worst weather. After a trip to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, the couple decided to save up and buy a second home there. They want a 2 bedroom condo on a 2nd floor in a gated community that's close to the beach. But they have a very firm budget of $150,000 which means they may not be able to buy as close to the beach as they'd like. The first place their real estate agent Sabine Gruss takes them to see is a model unit in a large complex with a big pool. The complex is about 5 minutes walking from the beach. The unit has 1 bedroom and 1 and a half bathrooms in 1000 square feet. It's listed at $115,000 but upgrading to a second floor unit means the price would be closer to $120,000. They like the large patio and the updated kitchen but none of the furniture or appliances are included, so that would be an extra expense. They also want two bedrooms in case they have guests. The second place Sabine takes them to see is a condo in a smaller complex. It's about 10 minutes walking from the beach. The condo is on the second floor, and has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in 1100 square feet. It's listed at the top of their price range, at $150,000. They like the small balcony but not the view of the countryside or the small pool in the complex. But Cheryl loves the updated kitchen and bathrooms, and having 2 bedrooms is a big plus. The third place they look at is actually a single family home. It's priced at $148,000 and has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in 1500 square feet. The house itself is older and would need some work in the kitchen and bathrooms. And because it's larger they would have to buy more funriture to fill it up.

They also want to buy a place close to the beach. They have a budget of $700,000, and they've given themselves just 3 days to complete their search. Their real estate agent Bram Shook knows it might be difficult for them to find a place that's both close to the beach that also has ocean views, since in Nosara there is a wildlife refuge that separates all the homes from the beach.

877,"For 11-years, Jennifer, Russ and their three girls enjoyed the security of their close-knit Wisconsin community. But the couple had a nagging sense they were missing out on experiences beyond their reach. On a whim, Jennifer, an audiologist, applied to a position in New Zealand. And to the family's surprise, their future took a dramatic turn. They soon found themselves headed 8,000 miles from home to Auckland. When they arrived they settled into a rental, but quickly found its quarters too cramped. And since the city was agreeing with them, Jennifer and Russ decided to make the move more permanent and invest in a home. But to their dismay, properties in Auckland were few and far between. And in this sellers' market, most homes were sold on the auction block to the highest bidder. So with dad not working and only one income coming in, the couple were faced with a challenging house hunt. And finding a home in their 700,000 dollar budget with enough space for a family of five and the character that Jennifer craved would be tough. Watch how they manage the city's pricey auction-based housing market when House Hunters International arrives in Auckland, New Zealand.",8-Sep-14,S70E01,Wisconsinites Hoping to Settle in Auckland Must Consider Buying a Home off the Auction Block,1,70,2014,Wisconsin,United States,Auckland ,New Zealand,0,"Wisconsin, United States","Auckland , New Zealand",All,44.4308975,-89.6884637,-36.852095,174.7631803,13161.71,Can get data,0

Now they're engaged to be married and her volunteer assignment has come to an end, but instead of returning to the states, Ginger is staying in Africa and moving to George's hometown of Mbabane. George needs to live close to the city for work, and while Ginger is excited to live with modern conveniences like indoor plumbing and a full kitchen, she's a little anxious about being too close to city life too soon.
